Example 1:
Masses:
Body 1: Mass = 2, Center of Mass = (1, 1.5)
Body 2: Mass = 4, Center of Mass = (7, 1)

Contacts:
Contact 1: Body A = 1, Body B = 0, Contact Point = (1, 0), Normal Angle = 1.57, Friction Coefficient = 0.40
Contact 2: Body A = 1, Body B = 2, Contact Point = (4, 4), Normal Angle = 0.79, Friction Coefficient = 0.10
Contact 3: Body A = 2, Body B = 0, Contact Point = (5, 0), Normal Angle = 1.57, Friction Coefficient = 0.40
Contact 4: Body A = 2, Body B = 0, Contact Point = (9, 0), Normal Angle = 1.57, Friction Coefficient = 0.40

The assembly would collapse.

Example 2:
Masses:
Body 1: Mass = 2, Center of Mass = (1, 1.5)
Body 2: Mass = 4, Center of Mass = (7, 1)

Contacts:
Contact 1: Body A = 1, Body B = 0, Contact Point = (1, 0), Normal Angle = 1.57, Friction Coefficient = 0.40
Contact 2: Body A = 1, Body B = 2, Contact Point = (4, 4), Normal Angle = 0.79, Friction Coefficient = 0.30
Contact 3: Body A = 2, Body B = 0, Contact Point = (5, 0), Normal Angle = 1.57, Friction Coefficient = 0.40
Contact 4: Body A = 2, Body B = 0, Contact Point = (9, 0), Normal Angle = 1.57, Friction Coefficient = 0.40

The assembly remains standing.
